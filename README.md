# Loan Eligibility Predictor App

## Project Description

A web app that predicts loan eligibility based on applicant data using a LightGBM classifier. The app performs data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection to provide accurate loan approval predictions.

## Database Used

The app uses a dataset containing various applicant attributes like income and credit history for prediction.

## Model Architecture

The app employs LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, for efficient and accurate classification. The model is fine-tuned using the ROC-AUC curve for optimal performance.
